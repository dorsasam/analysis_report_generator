# Code Generator AI Workshop Project - July 2024
## Overview
This repository contains the code developed during the Code Generator AI workshop held in July 2024. 
The project involves creating two agents using the Together and Hugging Face APIs. 
The first agent generates a statistical report of the given dataset, while the second agent counts the number of NaN values in each column and plots the result using a bar chart. 
At the end of the project, the statistical report followed by the plot is extracted in PDF format.

## Agents
- Statistical Report Agent: This agent creates a detailed statistical report of the provided dataset.
- NaN Counter and Plotting Agent: This agent counts the number of NaN values in each column and generates a bar chart of the results.

## Obtain API Keys
- Together API Key
- Hugging Face API Key

## Credits
